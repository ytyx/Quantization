# Quantization Fundamentals for Model Compression

This repository provides an overview of quantization techniques for model compression, helping to make machine learning models lighter, faster, and more resource-efficient. It covers essential concepts, algorithms, and practical applications of quantization in the context of deploying efficient deep learning models.

## Overview

As deep learning models grow in size, deploying them on devices with limited computational resources (e.g., mobile devices, IoT devices) poses significant challenges. Quantization is a model compression technique that reduces memory footprint and inference latency by representing model parameters with lower-precision data types. This process, while impactful, can be complex and requires careful attention to avoid significant performance degradation.

## Contents

- **Introduction to Quantization**: Basic principles of quantization and why it's essential for model deployment.
- **Types of Quantization**:
  - **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)**: Quantizing weights after training without retraining the model.
  - **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: Training the model with quantization applied, yielding higher accuracy than PTQ.
- **Quantization Techniques**:
  - **Uniform Quantization**: Mapping values to a set of evenly spaced discrete levels.
  - **Non-Uniform Quantization**: Using non-linear mappings to preserve critical information for specific use cases.
  - **Per-Layer vs. Per-Channel Quantization**: Differentiating techniques based on the granularity of quantization.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics to assess quantized model performance, including accuracy and model size reduction.
